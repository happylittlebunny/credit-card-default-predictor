# Credit Card Default Predictor
In this project, we constructed a machine learning pipeline for a credit card default classifier using data from UCI Machine Learning Repository. After extensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, we compared the performance of 8 different models, including logistic regression, decision tree, Naive Bayes classifier, random forest, extreme gradient bosting, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron and deep learning on the dataset. Performance of each model was evaluated using precision, recall and F1 score. Finally, we ensembled all models using majority votes. Out best single model was random forest, while the ensembled model achieved the highest F1 score.
